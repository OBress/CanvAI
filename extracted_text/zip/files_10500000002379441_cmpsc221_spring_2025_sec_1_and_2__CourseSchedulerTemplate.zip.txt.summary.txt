A Python script, `extract_text_from_downloads.py`, repeatedly failed with a `ValueError` when calling `path.relative_to`. The error occurred because the script attempted to calculate relative paths for various files, primarily from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\andy\AppData\Local\Temp`), which were not subpaths of the designated `downloads` directory (`C:\Users\andy\Videos\hackpsu_fa25\downloads`), causing the path comparison to fail.
