Instructor: Dr. Suman Saha
Midterm-I Practice Exam
General Instructions about Midterm-I:
Exam Date: September 29, 2025
Exam Time: 8:10 PM - 10:00 PM
1. If you have any conflict, you are requested to contact the instructor at least 72 hours1
before the exam and inform them about it.
2. If you are someone who requires any special accommodations, please reach out to the in-
structor at least 72 hours before the exam and inform them of your requirements, in order
to accommodate well in advance.
3. If you are sick or unfit and are prescribed rest or quarantine by the medical authorities during
the exam hours, we request you to kindly inform the instructor with the relevant paperwork.
4. Kindly arrive at the exam hall 10-15 minutes before the scheduled time to settle yourself
in and follow the instructions for seating (if any). You will have the seating plan informed
to you 36 hours before the exam schedule.
5. It is mandatory to carry Penn State Student ID (Physical/ Mobile ID+) to the exam
hall. No other ID(s) will be accepted for verifying your submission.
6. This exam will be a closed book and closed note with no cheat sheets permitted .
7.No electronic devices are allowed on the desk while taking the exam. You should only
have your writing instruments and the exam paper on your desk while working on the exam.
8. Make sure your writing instruments are high contrast (this is required for better scan-
ning of your submissions on Gradescope).
9. If you have any questions during the exam, kindly raise your hand and one of the proctors
will reach out to you.
10. Any violations will lead to direct consequences as per the course’s academic integrity policies.
11. As per Penn State policy, most campus areas no longer require masks, with a few exceptions.
For safety amidst rising COVID cases, if you choose to wear a mask, we support you but
remember to verify your identity (without the mask) when submitting your exam copy.
All the very best for Midterm :)
1unless it’s an emergency- in that case, an exception will be made based on the severity of the situation.

Problem 1: Regular Expressions I

•Must end with one of the extensions: .com,.org, or.net.
Valid:
http://psu.com
https://example.org
https://abc.net
Invalid:
http://psu.edu – extension not allowed
https://1abc.com – domain contains a digit
2. Construct a regular expression for time in 12-hour format HH:MMAM orHH:MMPM where:
•HHranges from 01 to 12.
•MMranges from 00 to 59.
•The string must end with either AMorPM.
Valid:
01:00AM
12:45PM
09:59PM
Invalid:
00:15AM – hour cannot be 00
13:00PM – hour cannot exceed 12
7:30AM– hour must be two digits

3. Construct a regular expression over Σ ={a,b,c}for strings where the first and last symbols
are different, and the string length is at least 3.
Valid:
abc
bac
cbbba
Invalid:
aa– too short and same start/end
cb– too short
cacac– starts and ends with same symbol

Problem 2: Finite Automata I
1. Design a DFA recognizing the string over the alphabet {1,2,3}where the string starts with
a single 3followed by 1or2.
For example, accepted strings: 31,32,31231,313323; rejected strings: ϵ,3,33,123.
Draw the graph clearly with states and transitions. Mark the start state and all accepting
state(s). No explanation required. No transition table required.
2. Design a NFA recognizing the string over the alphabet {a,b,c}where the string has consec-
utiveas.
For example, accepted strings: aab,baaac,aabb,abccaaa; rejected strings: ϵ,a,aba,caba.
Draw the graph clearly with states and transitions. Mark the start state and all accepting
state(s). No explanation required. No transition table required.
3. Convert the following NFA transition table into equivalent DFA transition table using subset
construction.
Only DFA transition table is required. No Automata graph required. No explanation re-
quired. Also, mention the start state and all accepting state(s) in the derived DFA. You can
omit the row if no transitions going out from the state or it cannot be reached from the start
state.
NFA State xyz
q0{q1,q2}{q0}{q2}
q1{q2}{q1}ϕ
q2ϕ{q0,q2}{q1}
The start state is q0, and the accepting state is q2.

Problem 3: Finite Automata II
1. Given the regular expression " a(ab|cb)∗" over the alphabet Σ ={a,b,c}, build an equivalent
DFA.
Note: Draw the graph clearly with states and transitions. Mark the start state and all accepting
state(s). No explanation required. No transition table required.

Problem 4: Context Free Grammar - I
Consider the grammar:
1.L={w∈{0,1}∗|wstarts with 0 and ends with 1 }. Some valid strings are 01, 001, 0111,
000011111, etc.
(a) Provide CFG for the language mentioned above.
(b) Using grammar generated in part a), provide the left-most derivation for string 0011.
2.L={anb2n|n≥1}. Some valid strings in the language are ab, aabbbb, aaabbbbbb, etc.
(a) Provide a CFG for the language.

Problem 5: Context Free Grammar - II
1. (True or False): All regular grammars are also context-free grammars, but not all context-
free grammars are regular. Explain your answer clearly.
2. Briefly explain the four components of a context-free grammar (CFG). Give an example
production rule for illustration.
CMPSC461, Fall-2025 |Practice Midterm-I 6/11

Problem 6: Ambiguity - I
Convert each of the following regular expressions into an equivalent CFG using BNF notation. Your
grammar should be unambiguous and use a minimal number of production rules. To abbreviate
ranges of consecutive characters, you can use the syntax a|···|z.
1.<[1-9][0-9]+(:[0-9][0-9]+)*>
Matches strings like <10>and<1234:567> and<12:345:6789> but not <01>or<1234:56>
or<9876:>
2.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)+(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.(0|[0-9]*[1-9]))?
Matches strings like 0+0and123+456.7 and0.123+456.007 but not 1.2+456 or01+123or
123+456.700

Problem 7: Ambiguity - II
In Python, functions are declared using the defkeyword, a function name, and a pair of
parentheses containing a parameter list . This list contains zero or more variable names followed by
zero or more variables with default values. This parameter list can be expressed using the following
CFG:
S→X,Y|X|Y|ϵ
X→X,X|⟨var⟩
Y→Y,Y|⟨var⟩=⟨expr⟩
This grammar matches inputs like var 1,var 2=expr2but rejects inputs like var 1=expr1,var 2.
1. Show that the grammar is ambiguous using left-most derivation and the smallest possible
example. Clearly indicate which rule is being applied at each step.
2. The Dangling Else Problem showed that ambiguity can change the structure of a program.
Does this grammar cause the same issue? Why or why not?

Problem 8: Names, Scopes and Bindings I
Consider the following pseudo-code:
1int x = 100;
2
3v o i d helper () {
4 print (x);
5}
6
7v o i d recur ( int n) {
8 if(n > 0) {
9 int x = n;
10 recur (n - 1);
11 }e l s e {
12 helper ();
13 }
14}
15
16v o i d caller () {
17 int x = 50;
18 recur (2);
19}
20
21v o i d main () {
22 caller ();
23}
(a) Draw a diagram of the runtime stack at the exact moment the helper() function is called.
For each activation frame, clearly label its static link anddynamic link .
(b) What is the output of this program, assuming the language uses:
i. Static scoping?
ii. Dynamic scoping?

Problem 9: Name, Scope, and Binding II
Consider the following pseudo-code:
1t y p e d e f vo i d (* FuncPtr )();
2
3v o i d worker () {
4 print (val );
5}
6
7FuncPtr setup () {
8 int val = 50;
9 r e t u r n worker ;
10}
11
12v o i d recursive_executor ( int n, FuncPtr F) {
13 if(n > 0) {
14 int val = n * 10;
15 recursive_executor (n - 1, F);
16 }e l s e {
17 F();
18 }
19}
20
21v o i d main () {
22 FuncPtr my_func ;
23 my_func = setup ();
24 recursive_executor (2, my_func );
25}
(A)Draw the symbol tables for the scopes global,worker,setup, and recursive_executor .
(B)What is the output if the language uses shallow binding ? Justify by tracing variable
resolution from the call site.
(C)What is the output if the language uses deep binding ? Explain which referencing environ-
ment is captured when the function reference is created.
