Types are collections of values sharing structural properties and operations, crucial for program organization, optimization, and preventing type errors where operations are undefined for a given data type. Type systems impose constraints, categorized as static (compile-time checking) or dynamic (run-time checking), with tradeoffs in flexibility and performance. Languages are also classified as strongly or weakly typed based on error detection. Type systems define rules for equivalence (name vs. structural), compatibility, and inference.
