Problem 1

has t he fo llowing fo rwarding t able:

or each of the four interfaces, give the associated range of destination host addresses and the number 
of addresses in the range.  


Problem 2  
Consider an ISP that owns the block of addresses in 123.119.14.64/26. Suppose it wants to create three 
subnets, where Subnet1 supports at least 30 interfaces, Subnet2 supports at least 12 interfaces, and 
Subnet3 supports at least 9 interfaces. Provide the  network addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x)  of the 
three subnets  that satisfy these requirements.   
  

Problem 3  
Consider the network shown in Figure 1.   
 
Figure 1. Illustration for Problem 3.  
a) Give the network addresses of Subnets A, B, and C in the form of a.b.c.d/x , such that: Subnet A 
supports 6  interfaces, Subnet B supports 12  interfaces, Subnet C supports 30  interfaces.  
b) Using answer to a), provide the forwarding tables  (each row containing “prefix match” and 
“outgoing interface” fields)  for each of the three routers , so that the  shortest path  (in hop 
count)  is used  for each packet. Suppose that no packet will have a router interface as the final 
destination  (i.e., the destination IP address will always be for a host) . Denote the prefix in binary 
format; denote the outgoing interface  by the  subnet the packet needs to be forwarded to  (e.g., 
Router 1 can forward packets to Subnet A, Subnet D, Subnet F ).

Problem 4  
Consider sending a 5000 -byte datagram  (including IP header)  to a link  that has an MTU of 102 0 bytes. 
Suppose that the original datagram has an identification number of 301. Answer the following:  
a) How many fragments are generated?  
b) Which header fields are used to support fragmentation?  
c) What are the values of these header fields for each of the fragment?  
  

Problem 5  
Consider the SDN network shown in Figure 2. Specify the flow table entries in s2 (each row contains 
“match” and “action” fields) to  achieve  the following behaviors  (simultaneously) : 
• datagrams arriving on port 1 from hosts h5 or h6 that are destined to hosts h1 or h2 should be 
forwarded to port 2;  
•  datagrams arriving on port 2 from hosts h1 or h2 that are destined to hosts h5 or h6 should be 
forwarded to port 1;  
• datagrams arriving on ports 1 or 2 that are destined to hosts h3 or h4 should be delivered to the respective host;  
• datagrams from host h3 to hosts h1, h2, h5, and h6 should be forwarded to port 1;  
• datagrams from host h4 to hosts h1, h2, h5, and h6 should be forwarded to port 2;  
• allow TCP traffic  but block UDP traffic  between hosts h3 and h4.
