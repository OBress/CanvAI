Lambda calculus is a system describing functions via variables, application, and abstraction (λx:t). It defines free/bound variables, lexical scope, and first-class functions. Core operations are capture-avoiding substitution and reductions: α (renaming), β (function application: (λx:t)t0 = t[t0/x]), and η (simplification: λx:tx = t). Classical LC permits non-deterministic reduction order.
