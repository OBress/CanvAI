This Final Project Part 2 extends the Course Scheduler with Admin functions: display course rosters (scheduled/waitlisted), drop students (reassigning waitlisted), and drop courses (clearing enrolled students). Students can also drop courses (reassigning waitlisted). The GUI requires dropdowns and immediate change display. The database, identical to Part 1, must be empty and updated via PreparedStatements.
