1. Fermat’s Little Theorem: Simplify the following using Fermat’s Little Theorem:
(a) 5300mod 13
(b) 347mod 7
2. Linear Congruence:
(a) Find all solutions, if possible to 6 x≡4(mod 17 )
(b) Find all solutions, if possible to 2 x≡5(mod 8 )
(c) Find all solutions, if possible to 3 x≡6(mod 12 )
3. Chinese Remainder Theorem: Consider the following system of linear congruences:
x≡2 (mod 4)
6x≡3 (mod 15)
Solve for all solutions using CRT. (Hint: There are 3 unique solutions modulo 60)
4. RSA:
(a) Given p = 23 and q = 19. Compute the public and the private keys.
(b) Daniel wants to send the message M = 13 to Alice. Using Alice’s public and private keys,
calculate the ciphertext C, and the value for R when Alice recovers the message.
