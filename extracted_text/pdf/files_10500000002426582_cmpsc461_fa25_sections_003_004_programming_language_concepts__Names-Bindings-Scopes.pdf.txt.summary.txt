Semantic analysis validates programs, ensuring name, type, and declaration correctness by handling non-context-free syntax errors. Names bind to objects, with lifetimes determined by static, stack, or heap allocation. Lexical/static scopes (managed by symbol tables) define name visibility. Binding (shallow/deep) for function parameters and stack frames (using static/dynamic links) implement these scoping rules.
