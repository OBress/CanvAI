1.(2 pts.) We can apply the Master Theorem to
recurrences of the form T(n) =a·T(n
b)+O(2n·d)
(where a>0,b>1 and d≥0) and conclude that:
T(n) =

Θ(nd) ifd>logba
Θ(ndlogn) ifd=logba
Θ(nlogba) ifd<logba
(a) True
(b) False
Answer (b) False
Master Theorem applies to recurrences of the form
T(n) =a·T(n
b) +Θ(nd). Everything besides the
given T(n)is correct.
2.(2 pts.) The recurrence relation for the median-
of-medians algorithm can be approximated as
T(n) =Tn
5
+T7n
10
+O(n). What is the
overall time complexity derived from this recur-
rence?
(a)O(n2)
(b)O(nlogn)
(c)O(n)
(d)O(logn)
Answer (c) Solving this recurrence shows that the
total work is linear, as the subproblem sizes de-
crease geometrically, leading to a total time com-
plexity of O(n).
3.(2 pts.) Given two arrays of numbers x=
[2,4,12]andy= [3,4,5]. What would be the re-
sult of Merge (x,y)in the merge-sort algorithm?(a)[2,3,4,5,4,12]
(b)[2,5,4,4,3,12]
(c)[3,4,4,2,5,12]
(d)[2,3,4,4,5,12]
Answer (d) [2,3,4,4,5,12]
When Merge runs on two sorted arrays, it always
returns a sorted array.
4.(2 pts.) What is the role of the pivot in the
QuickSort algorithm?
(a) To sort the entire array in one step.
(b) To partition the array into two subarrays for
recursive sorting.
(c) To compute the median of the array elements.
(d) To merge two sorted subarrays.
Answer (b) To partition the array into two subar-
rays for recursive sorting.
5.(2 pts.) What is the time complexity of the stan-
dard divide-and-conquer algorithm for matrix mul-
tiplication?
(a)O(n4)
(b)O(n3)
(c)O(n2)
(d)O(nloglog n)
Answer (b) O(n3)
