1. Determine if the following relations are reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, transitive, equiv-
alence relation, or poset (i.e., partially ordered set) on the respective sets:
(a)R0={(a,a),(b,b),(a,c),(c,a)}onA0={a,b,c,d}
(b)R1={(a,a),(c,c),(b,b),(a,d),(d,b),(a,b),(a,c)}onA1={a,b,c,d,e}.
(c) Also, determine the relational properties that R1satisfies on A0from above.

X
Answer:
(a)Reflexive: Not reflexive since (d,d),(c,c)/∈R0.
Symmetric: Yes
Antisymmetric: No, since (a,c),(c,a)∈R0
Transitive: No, since (c,a),(a,c), but no (c,c)
R0is neither an equivalence relation nor a poset on A0.
(b)Reflexive: Not reflexive since (d,d),(e,e)/∈R1.
Symmetric: No, since (d,a)/∈R1
Antisymmetric: Yes
Transitive: Yes
R1is neither an equivalence relation nor a poset on A1.
(c)Reflexive: Not reflexive since (d,d)/∈R1.
Symmetric: No, since (d,a)/∈R1
Antisymmetric: Yes
Transitive: Yes
R1is neither an equivalence relation nor a poset on A0.
(d)Reflexive: Yes, any set is a subset of itself.
Symmetric: No
Antisymmetric: Yes, since equal sets can be interchangeably written as subsets of each
other.

2. Prove that the following relation Ris an equivalence relation on Z:
R={(x,y)∈Z×Z|x2−y2
4∈Z}
Answer:
Proof
The relation Ris an equivalence relation on set Zif it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
The relation Ris reflexive on set Zas∀x∈Z((x,x)∈R). This is because for any integer x,
x2−x2
4=0 and 0 ∈Z.
To check if it is symmetric, let’s assume a pair (a,b)∈Z×Zthat satisfies our relation R. If
(a,b)∈R,a2−b2
4∈Z. This means that a2−b2is divisible by 4. If a2−b2is divisible by 4,
b2−a2is also divisible by 4. Therefore,b2−a2
4∈Zand therefore, (b,a)∈R. Since we have
proved ∀a∀b((a,b)∈R→(b,a)∈R), the following relation is symmetric.
To check if it is transitive, let’s assume two pairs (a,b)and(b,c)∈Z×Zthat satisfies our
relation R. Therefore, (a,b)∈R∧(b,c)∈R, which means thata2−b2
4∈Zandb2−c2
4∈Z.
Since adding two integers results in an integer, we can say thata2−b2
4+b2−c2
4∈Z. Therefore,
a2−c2
4∈Z, which means that (a,c)∈R. Since we have proved ∀a∀b∀c((a,b)∈R∧(b,c)∈R→
(a,c)∈R, the following relation is transitive.
Therefore the relation above is an equivalence relation on Z.2
3. Let A=a,b,c,d,e. Suppose Ris an equivalence relation on A. Suppose Rhas three equivalence
classes. Also aRd andbRc. Write out Ras a set.
Answer:
Given that Ris an equivalence relation on A, we know Ris reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
From reflexivity, we know that (a,a),(b,b),(c,c),(d,d),(e,e)∈R.
From symmetry, we know that (a,d),(d,a),(b,c),(c,b)∈R.
Then, because Rhas three equivalence classes, and from the existing relations, we have [a] =
[d] ={a,d},[b] = [c] ={b,c}, and [e] ={e}.
Trying to add any other relations would result in a contradiction of the above findings. Try it
out yourself. Thus the set Ris:
R={(a,a),(b,b),(c,c),(d,d),(e,e),(a,d),(d,a),(b,c),(c,b)}

4. Define a relation RonZasxRyif and only if 3 x−5yis even. Prove Ris an equivalence relation.
Describe its equivalence classes.
Answer:
Equivalence Relation:
Informally , if 3x−5yis even, then xandymust have same parity. Try to prove it formally by
yourself.
The relation Ris an equivalence relation on set Zif it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
The relation Ris reflexive on set Zas∀x∈Z((x,x)∈R). This is because for any integer x,
3x−5x=−2x=2(−x), which is even by definition.
To check if it is symmetric, let’s assume a pair (a,b)∈Z×Zthat satisfies our relation R. If
(a,b)∈R, 3a−5b=2kwhere k∈Z. From the same parity property of xandyabove, it’s not
hard to see that, if a=2m,b=2nfor some m,n∈Z, then 3 b−5a=6n−10m=2(3n−5m). On
the other hand, if a=2m+1,b=2n+1 for some m,n∈Z, then 3 b−5a=6n+3−10m−5=
2(3n−5m−1). Therefore, in both cases, (b,a)∈R. Since we have proved ∀a∀b((a,b)∈R→
(b,a)∈R), the relation is symmetric.
To check if it is transitive, let’s assume two pairs (a,b)and(b,c)∈Z×Zthat satisfies our
relation R. Therefore, (a,b)∈R∧(b,c)∈R, which means that 3 a−5b=2k1and 3 b−5c=2k2
where k1,k2∈Z. Adding the two equations, we get 3 a−5c=2(k1+k2+b). Therefore,
(a,c)∈R. Since we have proved ∀a∀b∀c((a,b)∈R∧(b,c)∈R→(a,c)∈R, the relation is
transitive.
Therefore the relation above is an equivalence relation on Z.2
Equivalence Classes:
From the above, we already proved that xandymust have the same parity for xRy. As this is
the only constraint on xandy, the equivalence class containing 0 seems like a reasonable place
to start.
[0] ={x∈Z:x=2k,k∈Z}={...,−4,−2,0,2,4,...}
Note that [0] = [2] = [4] = [−2] = [−4] =..., which forms the first equivalence class. Following
the same logic, we can find the other equivalence class:
[1] ={x∈Z:x=2k+1,k∈Z}={...,−3,−1,1,3,...}
Note that [1] = [3] = [−1] = [−3] =..., which forms the second equivalence class.

5. Determine if the following relations are functions:
(a)f0:{1,2,3} → { 1,2,3}andf0={(1,1),(2,1),(3,2)}
(b)f1:{1,2,3,4} → { 1,2,3}andf1={(1,1),(2,1),(3,2)}
(c)f2:{a,b,c} → { a,b}andf2:{(a,a),(b,a),(b,c)}
Answer:
(a) Yes, it is a function. All elements in the domain are mapped to an element in the co-
domain and there is no one-to-many mapping.
(b) No, it is not a function (or an ill-defined function) since f1is not everywhere defined.
Any valid function needs to have all elements in the domain mapped to an element in the
co-domain. Here, 4 is not mapped.
(c)f2is not a function because bis mapped to canda. A one-to-many relation is not a
function.
6. Determine which functional properties the following functions satisfy and whether they are
bijective:
(a)f:Z→Qandf(x) =2x−3
5
(b)f:R→Randf(x) =3x2+11x
Answer:
(a)Injectivity:
Assume x1,x2∈Zandf(x1) =f(x2).
=⇒2x1−3
5=2x2−3
5
=⇒x1=x2
Thus, by the definition of injectivity, fis injective.
Surjectivity:
Suppose that for some x∈Z,y=f(x). Then,
y=2x−3
5
=⇒x=5y+3
2
Fory=2∈Q,x=13
2/∈Z. Therefore, fis not surjective.
(b)Injectivity:
Not injective because f(1) =f(−14
3) =14 and 1 ̸=−14
3.
Surjectivity:
For some x∈R, lety=f(x)
=⇒y=3x2+11x
=⇒3x2+11x−y=0
=⇒x=−11+√121+12y
6
Fory=−11,x/∈R
Therefore, fis not surjective on R
