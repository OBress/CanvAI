1.(2 pts.) While performing InsertionSort on the
array {8, 2, 6, 2, 3, 1 }, which of the following is
NOT a transition state of the array:
(a) 2 6 8 2 3 1
(b) 2 2 3 6 8 1
(c) 2 2 8 6 3 1
(d) 2 8 6 2 3 1
(e) None of the above
Answer
2.(2 pts.) When analyzing an algorithm’s running
time, we use big-O to denote its worst-case perfor-
mance and use big-Omega to denote its best-case
performance.
(a) True
(b) False
Answer
3.(2 pts.) Let f(n) =10n2andg(n) =n3+5n.
Which of the following is correct?
I.f(n) =O(g(n))
II.g(n) =O(f(n))
(a) I is correct
(b) II is correct
(c) Both I and II are correct
Answer4.(2 pts.) In order to show 2 (n+1)2=Ω(n2)by
definition, which of the following choices of cand
n0is NOT valid?
(a)c=1.11 and n0=111
(b)c=2.42 and n0=10
(c)c=0.5 and n0=16
(d)c=1 and n0=1
(e)c=2 and n0=3
Answer
5.(2 pts.) Which of the following statement re-
garding MergeSort is correct?
(a) MergeSort always divides the input array into
two equal halves
(b) MergeSort does not allow duplicate elements
in the input
(c) MergeSort always runs in O(nlogn)time
even if the input array is split arbitrarily at
each step
(d) MergeSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm
where all the sorting happens at the merge
step
(e) None of the above
