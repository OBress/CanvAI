1.(2 pts.) Suppose in a directed graph, AandB
are strongly connected components, and there is
an edge from a vertex in Ato a vertex in B. Then:
amax w∈Apost (w)>max v∈Bpost (v)
bmax w∈Apre(w)<max v∈Bpre(v)
cmax w∈Apost (w)<max v∈Bpost (v)
dNone of the above
2.(2 pts.) In an unweighted, connected, undirected
graph, which of the following is true about using
BFS to find the shortest path from a source node
S?
aBFS may fail if the graph has cycles.
bBFS works only on trees.
cBFS always finds the shortest path.
dBFS doesn’t work on undirected graphs.
3.(2 pts.) Dijkstra’s Algorithm does not work
correctly on:
aDirected weighted graphs
bGraphs with negative-weight edges
cUndirected unweighted graphs4.(2 pts.) In a weighted graph where the weights
of all edges are unique, there is always a unique
shortest path from a source to a destination.
aTrue
bFalse
5.(2 pts.) In Dijkstra’s algorithm, after a vertex u
is added to the visited set R, which of the following
is always true?
adist (u)may still decrease later due to a
shorter path.
bdist (u)is equal to the true shortest-path dis-
tance from the source.
cdist (u)is the minimum among all vertices in
the graph.
duhas no outgoing edges.
