1. Suppose a company has two factories, Factory Aand Factory B, that produce 60% and 40% of
its products, respectively. Factory Aproduces 2% defective products while Factory Bproduces
3% defective products. If a detective item is drawn at random, what is the probability that it
was produced by factory B?
Answer:
LetDbe the event that a product is defective, and let Bbe the event that the product was pro-
duced by Factory B. We want to find P(D|B).
P(B) =0.4,P(A) =0.6,P(D|B) =0.03,P(D|A) =0.02
P(B|D) =P(D|B)×P(B)
P(D|B)×P(B) +P(D|A)×P(A)=0.4×0.03
0.6×0.02+0.4×0.03≈0.444
2. Two dice are rolled. Let:
•A= ”Sum of two dice equals 3.”
•B= ”Sum of two dice equals 7.”
•C= ”At least one of the dice shows a 1.”
(a) What is P(A|C)?
(b) What is P(B|C)?
Answer:
(a)P(A|C) =P(A∩C)
P(C). There are only 2 outcome favorable to both AandC, which are (1,2),
(2,1). Thus:
P(A∩C) =2
36,P(C) =11
36,P(A|C) =2
36
11
36=2
11.
(b)P(B|C) =P(B∩C)
P(C). There are 2 outcomes favorable to both BandC, which are (1,6) and
(6,1). Thus:
P(B∩C) =2
36,P(C) =11
36,P(B|C) =2
36
11
36=2
11.

3. A student is given a multiple choice exam with 10 questions, each question with five possible
answers. This student guesses randomly for each question.
(a) What’s the probability this student gets exactly 6 questions correctly?
(b) What’s the probability this student gets at least 6 questions correctly?
Answer:
(a) The probability that the student guesses exactly 6 questions correctly out of 10 is calcu-
lated using the binomial probability formula:
P(X=k) =n
k
pk(1−p)n−k
where n=10,k=6, and p=0.2. Therefore:
P(X=6) =10
6
(0.2)6(0.8)4≈0.0055
(b) The probability that the student guesses at least 6 questions correctly is the sum of the
probabilities of guessing 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 questions correctly:
P(X≥6) =10
∑
k=610
k
(0.2)k(0.8)10−k≈0.0063
