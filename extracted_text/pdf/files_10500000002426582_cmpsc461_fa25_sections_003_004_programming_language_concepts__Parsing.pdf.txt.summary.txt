CMPSC 461's parsing unit examines parse trees as graphical derivations, detailing their root (start symbol), internal nodes (RHS grammar), and terminal leaves. It addresses grammar ambiguity—when a string has multiple parse trees—and its resolution through precedence, associativity, and grammar rewriting. The content introduces Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) as simplified parse trees, and differentiates between top-down and bottom-up parsing techniques.
