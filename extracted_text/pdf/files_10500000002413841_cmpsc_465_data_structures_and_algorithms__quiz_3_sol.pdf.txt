1.(2 pts.) In a min-heap , what is the relationship
between the value of a parent node and its chil-
dren?
(a) The parent node is always greater than its
children.
(b) The parent node is always greater than or
equal to its children.
(c) The parent node is always smaller than or
equal to its children.
(d) There is no specific relationship.
Answer c) The parent node is always smaller than
or equal to its children.
2.(2 pts.) Performing an IncreaseKey operation on
the root of a max-heap can violate the heap prop-
erty, which requires a HeapifyDown operation to
restore.
(a) True
(b) False
Answer (b) False. As the maximum element is at
the root of a max heap, increasing it’s value does
not violate heap property.
3.(2 pts.) Consider a max-heap stored in an ar-
rayA[1..7] = [ 7,6,4,1,5,2,3]. After performing
the following two operations in sequence, what is
the resulting heap?
• IncreaseKey(6, 17)
• Insert(12)
(a)[7,6,4,1,5,17,3]
(b)[17,7,12,4,1,5,2,3]
(c)[17,12,7,6,5,4,3,1]
(d)[17,12,7,5,6,4,3,1]
Answer (c)[17,12,7,6,5,4,3,1]. After the
Update-Key operation, the resulting heap will
be :[17,6,7,1,5,4,3]. Next, insert 12 at the endand perform heapify from bottom-up and we end
up with the final result [17,12,7,6,5,4,3,1].
4.(2 pts.) What is the minimum number of nodes
abinary heap can have, given that its height is h?
(a) 2h−1
(b) 2h−1
(c) 2h
(d) 2h−1+1
Answer (c) 2h. A binary heap is a complete binary
tree. The minimum number of nodes for a tree of
height his achieved when all levels up to h−1 are
full, and there’s only one node at level h. A full bi-
nary tree of height h−1 has 2h−1 nodes. Adding
the single node at height hgives a total of 2hnodes.
5.(2 pts.) A programmer implemented the Heap-
Sort algorithm discussed in lecture, but acciden-
tally used a min-heap instead of a max-heap.
Which of the following is the most likely outcome?
(a) The algorithm will fail to sort the array.
(b) It will sort the array in ascending order, the
same as with a max-heap.
(c) It will sort the array in descending order, the
opposite as with a max-heap.
(d) It will produce a correct sort, but with higher
time complexity.
Answer (c) It will sort the array in descending or-
der, which is the reverse of a max heap. Heapsort
works by repeatedly extracting the root and plac-
ing it at the end of the array. With a min heap, the
smallest element is at the root and it is sent to the
end of the array. Doing this repeatedly result in an
array sorted in descending order.
