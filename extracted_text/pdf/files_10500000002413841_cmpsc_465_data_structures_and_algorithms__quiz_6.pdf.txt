1.(2 pts.) The Bellman-Ford algorithm can be
used to find shortest paths in an undirected graph
with negative edge weights.
aTrue
bFalse
2.(2 pts.) While running Bellman-Ford on a graph
with no negative cycles, updating every edge |V|2
times instead of |V|−1 times has no effect on the
output.
aTrue
bFalse
3.(2 pts.) Which of the following recursions is
used in Floyd-Warshall? Here, dist k[i,j]is the
shortest path from vertex ito vertex jusing only
the first kvertices and ℓ(i,j)is the weight of the
edge from itoj.
adist k[i,j] =dist k−1[i,j]+ℓ(k−1,j)
bdist k[i,j] =dist k[i,k]+dist k[k,j]
cdist k[i,j] =max(
dist k−1[i,j],
dist k−1[i,k]+dist k−1[k,j])
ddist k[i,j] =min(
dist k−1[i,j],
dist k−1[i,k]+dist k−1[k,j])4.(2 pts.) In a valid flow, the total flow out of the
unique source vertex s(i.e., the value of the flow)
is greater than the total flow into the unique sink
vertex t.
aTrue
bFalse
5.(2 pts.) In a network flow, if the capacity of
an edge is increased, the maximum flow from the
source to the sink must increase.
aTrue
bFalse
