1. Dijkstra’s. Suppose Dijkstra’s Algorithm is run on the following graph, starting at node A.
(i) Draw a table showing the intermediate distance values of all the nodes at each iteration of the
algorithm.
(ii) Show the final shortest-path tree.
2. Bellman-Ford. Suppose Bellman-Ford is used to find all the shortest paths from node S.
(i) Draw a table showing the intermediate distance values of all the nodes at each iteration of the
algorithm.
(ii) Show the final shortest-path tree.
3. Floyd-Warshall. Run Floyd-Warshall to find all pairs of shortest paths in the following graph. Show
the distance matrix for each step of the algorithm, including the initial and final matrices.

4. Dijkstra’s with Negative Edges. Professor F. Lake suggests the following algorithm for finding the
shortest path from node sto node tin a directed graph with some negative edges: add a large constant
to each edge weight so that all the weights become positive, then run Dijkstra’s algorithm starting at
node s, and return the shortest path found to node t. Is this a valid method? Either prove that it works
correctly or give a counterexample.
5. Network Flow. Answer the following questions on the given flow network G= (V,E):
(a) Consider a function f:E→Ndefined by f(s,a) =6,f(s,b) =5,f(a,c) =5,f(a,d) =2,
f(b,c) =2,f(b,d) =3,f(c,t) =8, and f(d,t) =5. Is it a valid flow on G? If not, list all the
violations and fix them.
(b) It turns out the above (after your fixes) flow fis a maximum flow in this network. We call
an edge in the network a bottleneck edge if increasing its capacity results in an increase in the
maximum flow, namely, fcan improved to have a larger value. List all bottleneck edges in the
network G.
(c) Give an example of a network that has no bottleneck edges.
