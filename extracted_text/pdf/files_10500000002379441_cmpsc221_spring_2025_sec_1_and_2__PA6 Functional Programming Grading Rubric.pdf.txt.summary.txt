The PA6 Functional Programming rubric deducts 30 points per part (a,b,c) for stream processing errors (not converting to stream, incorrect sorting by partDescription/pricePerItem/quantity, or poor display format like non-columnar/incorrect decimal places). Not using template code costs 10 points. Late submissions incur a 4% daily penalty, up to 40% maximum. Good object-oriented programming practices are also expected.
