This lecture explores Divide-and-Conquer algorithms. Median of Medians for selection achieves O(n) time by grouping elements to find a robust pivot. Matrix multiplication, typically O(n^3), can be improved by Strassen's algorithm to O(n^2.81) using 7 subproblems. Additionally, both the Closest Pair of Points and Convex Hull problems are solved efficiently with O(n log n) Divide-and-Conquer approaches.
