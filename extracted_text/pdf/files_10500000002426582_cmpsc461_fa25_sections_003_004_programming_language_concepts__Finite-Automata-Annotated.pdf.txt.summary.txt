CMPSC 461 explores implementing regular expressions (REs) via finite automata. REs are equivalent to NFAs and DFAs. Implementation involves converting REs to NFAs, then either simulating the NFA directly or converting it to a DFA for simulation. This process forms the basis of lexical analysis, addressing token ambiguities through principles like longest matching prefix and token priority.
