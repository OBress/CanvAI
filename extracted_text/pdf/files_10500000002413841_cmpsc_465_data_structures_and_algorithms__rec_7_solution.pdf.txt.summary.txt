This CMPSC 465 worksheet solution covers Max Flow Min Cut using Ford-Fulkerson, including residual graph construction. It details reducing multi-source/multi-sink max-flow problems and employee-project assignment to standard max-flow instances. Additionally, a linear-time algorithm is presented for verifying a max-flow solution by checking for an s-t path in the residual graph via BFS.
