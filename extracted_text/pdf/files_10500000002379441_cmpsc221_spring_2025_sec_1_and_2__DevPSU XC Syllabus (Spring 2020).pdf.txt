What is DevPSU Learning?
 
DevPSU Learning is an 8 week learning program intended to teach core competencies of collaborative
 
software development in a peer-driven environment.
 
 
This program gives students the opportunity to gain valuable experience and interactions outside of the
 
classroom, in preparation for a career in industry or research.
 
After completion of DevPSU Learning, students continue on to DevPSU Startup where they create and
 
implement software programs and systems in small, collaborative teams.
