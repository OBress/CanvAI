CMPSC 465 HW covers 5 graph problems: Dijkstra with reinsertion (correct/negative edges, exponential); Budget Bellman-Ford (k-edge paths, O(k(|V|+|E|))); Ordered Bellman-Ford (correct, variable rounds); Pinned Nodes (Floyd-Warshall for paths via S, O(n^3)); Bottleneck Path (Floyd-Warshall for min max-edge-weight, O(n^3)).
