Problem 1  
Suppose the content of a packet is 1101 0110 1001 1011. Give the error detection bits for each of the 
following codes:  
a) 1-D even parity check  
b) 2-D odd parity check  by arranging data into a square matrix  
c) 8-bit checksum (not Internet checksum)  
d) CRC for the generator G = 1001  
  

Problem 2  
Derive the efficiency of slotted ALOHA ( you must show the steps) : 
a) Suppose there are N transmitters, each transmitting with probability p in each slot. What is the 
probability of successfully delivering a packet in a given slot?  
b) What is the value of p that maximizes the success probability in a)?  
c) What is the limit of the success probability as N goes to infinity?  
  

Problem 3  
Repeat a) –  c) in Problem 2 for pure (unslotted) ALOHA.  
  

Problem 4  
Consider the network in Figure 1. Suppose that host A just connected to the network and  has an empty 
ARP table . Suppose that the ARP tables at  other hosts are up to date.  
 
Figure 1. Illustration of Problem 5.  
a) How many subnets are there in this network? List the interfaces in each subnet (by their IP 
address and MAC address).  
b) Suppose A is a mobile host (e.g., laptop). How does A obtain its IP address? How does it obtain 
its MAC address?  
c) Suppose B is a server whose hostname is known to A. A wants to send a packet to B. How does A 
know B’ IP address?  
d) In the packet sent by A destined to B, what are the values of these header fields: MAC src, MAC 
dest, IP src, IP dest ? 
e) How does A know the IP address of the left interface of R1 (i.e., IP3)? How does A know the MAC 
address of this interface (i.e., MAC3)?  
f) Repeat d) for the packet sent by R1  (i.e., the frame containing the A -to-B IP datagram that is 
sent by R1) .

Problem 5  
Consider an Ethernet with the topology shown in Figure 2. Suppose that host A sends a frame to host I, 
and host I responds a frame to host A. Initially, all switch tables are empty. Use the host label to denote 
its MAC address (e.g., host A’s MAC address will be A).  
 
Figure 2. Illustration of a multi -switch Ethernet.  
a) Suppose that the frame sent by A arrives at S1 at time t1, S4 at time t2, S2 at time t3, and S3 at 
time t4. Give the content of the switch tables at S1, …, S4 (each entry contains fields “MAC 
address”, “interface”, “time”) when the frame arrives at host I.  
b) Suppose that the response frame sent by I arrives at S3 at time t5, S4 at time t6, and S1 at time 
t7. Give the content of the four switch tables when the frame arrives at host A.  
c) Is the response frame received by S2? Why?
