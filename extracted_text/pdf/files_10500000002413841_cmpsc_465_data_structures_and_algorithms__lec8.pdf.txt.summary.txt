CMPSC 465 LECTURE VIII introduces Binary Heaps after reviewing stacks and queues. Binary heaps are complete binary trees enforcing the max-heap property (parent >= children). This structure allows for O(1) GetMax and O(logn) insertion, where new elements are added to the end and then "HeapifyUp" (bubble up) to restore the heap property. Complete trees map efficiently to array representations.
