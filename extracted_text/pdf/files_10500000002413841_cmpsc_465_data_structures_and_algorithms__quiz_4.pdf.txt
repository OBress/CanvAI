possible in a simple undirected graph having nver-
tices?
(a)n(n+1)
2
(b)n(n−1)

4.(2 pts.) The topological sort of a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is always unique.
(a) True

5.(2 pts.) In a DFS tree, back edges are defined as:
(a) Edges that lead to the root node.
(b) Edges that point into the current node.
(c) Edges that lead to a child node.
