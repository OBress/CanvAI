CMPSC 465 covered MergeSort's O(n log n) time complexity, demonstrating its asymptotic optimality for comparison-based sorting using the Information Theory Lower Bound (ITLB). The ITLB, derived from decision tree analysis, establishes an Î©(n log n) lower bound for comparisons. The lecture also introduced QuickSort, a divide-and-conquer algorithm with O(n) partitioning, noting its O(n^2) worst-case time complexity.
