Problem 1  
Consider a source and a destination connected by N links (i.e., N -1 packet switches). Each link has 
capacity R bps, and propagation delay d seconds. Ignore processing  delays  and assume that initially all 
the buffers are empty.  
a) Give a formula for the end -to-end delay of sending one packet of length L bits.  
b) Generalize the formula for sending P packets of L bits each.  
c) Now suppose the links (in the order from source to destination) have capacities R 1 < R 2 < …< R N, 
and propagation delays d 1, d2, …, d N (with arbitrary values). Give formula for the end -to-end 
delay of sending P packets of L bits each.  
d) Repeat c), but assume that R 1 > R 2 > …> R N (still arbitrary values for d 1, d2, …, d N). 
  

Problem 2  
Consider an 8 -car caravan, where the propagation speed is 100 km/hour, each car takes 1 minute to 
pass a toll both. The caravan starts in front of toll booth A, goes through toll booth B, and ends after 
passing toll booth C. Let d AB and d BC be the distance between A -B, and B -C.  
a) Suppose d AB = d BC = 10 km. What is the end -to-end delay if the caravan travels together (i.e., the 
first car must wait for the last car after passing each toll booth)?  
b) Repeat a), but assume the cars travel separately (i.e. , not waiting for each other).  
c) Repeat a) and b), but suppose d AB = d BC = 100 km.  
d) Still suppose d AB = d BC = 100 km. Suppose toll booth B takes 10 minute to pass each car (A and C 
still takes 1 minute per car). Where is the first car when the second car passes B?  
e) Still assume that toll booth B takes 10 minute  to pass each car,  and A and C each takes 1 minute 
per car. W hat is the maximum value of d BC such that the first car has passed C when the second 
car passes B (dAB is irrelevant  here )? 
  

Problem 3  
Suppose users share a 9 Mbps link. Each user consumes 1.5 Mbps when transmitting, and only transmits 
with probability 0.2.  
a) How many users can be supported using circuit switching?  
b) Assume packet switching for the rest of the problem. What is the probability that 7 out of 10 
users are transmitting?   
c) What is the maximum number of users, such that the probability of exceeding the link capacity 
is no more than 0.01?  Hint: Gradually increase the number of users and evaluate the probability 
of exceeding the link capacity for each value of this number.  
d) What is the average link utilization under the maximum number of users computed in c),  
defined as 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒  𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡  𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒  𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒ℎ𝑒𝑒 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑙
𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑙 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 𝑐𝑐? 
  

Problem 4 
Refer to Chapter 1 P31 for definition of message segmentation (hint:  this is analogous to letting the cars 
travel separately as opposed to travel ing together in the caravan analogy ). Suppose the source has a 
message of 1 Gbit to be sent to the destination via a 3 -link path (through two packet switches). Each link 
has a capacity of 10 Mbps and a propagation delay of 0. 1 seconds. Ignore queuing and processing 
delays.  
a) What is the end -to-end delay to send the message without segmentation?  
b) What is the end -to-end delay if the message is sent with segmentation into 500 packets, of 2 
Mbit each?  
c) Repeat a) and b) when there are 10 links (i.e., 9 packet switches) between the source and the 
destination.  
d) Suppose now that each packet needs a header of 1 Kbit . Repeat the calculation in b) (for the 3 -
link case).  
e) What are the benefits of message segmentation?  
f) What are the drawbacks of message segmentation?  
  

Problem 5 
Suppose you are asked to design a highway control system where all the sensors share a 1  Mbps link to 
the control center. Each sensor transmits with probability 0.1. When it transmits, it can transmit either 
only numerical measurements at 0.1 Mbps , or both numerical measurements and video at 1 Mbps.  
a) How many sensors can be supported using circuit switching if they transmit only numerical 
measurements? And what if they transmit both numerical measurements and video?  
b) Assume that sensors only transmit numerical measurements. How many sensors can be 
supported using packet switching such that the probability of exceeding the link capacity is no 
more than 0.005?  
c) Repeat b) but assume that sensors transmit both numerical measurements and video.  
d) Compare b -c) with a), at which transmission rate (0.1 Mbps or 1 Mbps) the sensors benefit more 
from packet switching?
