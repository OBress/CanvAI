1.(2 pts.) Bellman-Ford can be used to find short-
est paths in an undirected graph with negative
edge weights.
aTrue
bFalse
Answer False
An undirected graph can be treated as a directed
graph by replacing all edges with one forward and
backward edge between connected vertices. As a
result, this graph will contain cycles with nega-
tive edge weights. Bellman-Ford algorithm can’t
be used in this case.
2.(2 pts.) While running Bellman-Ford on a graph
with no negative cycles, updating every edge |V|2
times instead of |V|−1 times has no effect on the
output.
aTrue
bFalse
Answer True
The operation of updating the shortest path ending
with a given edge is safe. Once the shortest paths
are found, the output will not change.
3.(2 pts.) Which of the following recursions is
used in Floyd-Warshall? Here, dist k[i,j]is the
shortest path from vertex ito vertex jusing only
the first kvertices and ℓ(i,j)is the weight of the
edge from itoj.
adist k[i,j] =dist k−1[i,j]+ℓ(k−1,j)
bdist k[i,j] =dist k[i,k]+dist k[k,j]
cdist k[i,j] =max(
dist k−1[i,j],
dist k−1[i,k]+dist k−1[k,j])
ddist k[i,j] =min(
dist k−1[i,j],
dist k−1[i,k]+dist k−1[k,j])Answer (d):
The new shortest path is the minimum between
the known shortest path and some possible shorter
path that goes through node k.
4.(2 pts.) In a valid flow, the total flow out of the
unique source vertex s(i.e., the value of the flow)
is greater than the total flow into the unique sink
vertex t.
aTrue
bFalse
Answer False
They are equal to each other.
5.(2 pts.) In a network flow, if the capacity of
an edge is increased, the maximum flow from the
source to the sink must increase.
aTrue
bFalse
Answer False
Increasing the capacity of an edge in a network
flow does not always increase the maximum flow.
