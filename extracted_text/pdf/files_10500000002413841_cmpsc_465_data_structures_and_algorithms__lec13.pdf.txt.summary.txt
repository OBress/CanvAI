CMPSC 465 covers Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in directed graphs, defined as vertex sets with bidirectional paths. The efficient O(|V|+|E|) algorithm utilizes two DFS traversals: first on the reverse graph (GR) to determine post-order numbers, then on the original graph (G), processing vertices in decreasing post-order to identify and extract each SCC.
