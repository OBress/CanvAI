Problem 1  
Consider the following string of ASCII characters that were captured by  Wireshark when the browser 
sent an HTTP GET message (i.e., this is the  actual content of an HTTP GET message). The characters 
<cr><lf> are  carriage return and line -feed characters (that is, the italized character string  <cr> in the text 
below represents the single carriage- return character that was  contained at that point in the HTTP 
header). Answer the following questions,  indicating where in the HTTP GET message below you find the 
answer.  
GET /cs453/index.html HTTP/1.1<cr><lf>Host: gaia.cs.umass.edu<cr><lf>User-
Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows;U; Windows NT 5.1; en- US; rv:1.7.2)

<cr><lf>Keep- Alive: 300<cr><lf>Connection:keep- alive<cr><lf><cr><lf> 
a) What is the URL of the document requested by the browser?  
b) What version of HTTP is the browser running?  
c) Does the browser request a non -persistent or a persistent connection?  
d) What is the IP address of the host on which the browser is running?  
e) What type of browser initiates this message? Why is the browser type needed in an HTTP 
request message?  
  

Problem 2  
The text below shows the reply sent from the server in response to the HTTP  GET message in the 
question above. Answer the following questions, indicating  where in the message below you find the 
answer.

document text following here (not shown)> 
a) Was the server able to successfully find the document or not? What time  was the document 
reply provided?  
b) When was the document last modified?  
c) How many bytes are there in the document being returned?  
d) What are the first 5 bytes of the document being returned? Did the server  agree to a persistent 
connection?  
  

Problem 3  
Using your  Web browser to obtain a Web page containing a small HTML file referring to 12 objects, each 
of size 100K bits. Suppose that for each of the following questions, the IP address of the Web server is 
initially unknown , and that your host needs to visit all  types of DNS servers (one  server  per type) to 
retrieve the IP address. Each visi t to a DNS server  takes an RTT of 10 ms. The path  between your host 
and the Web server has an RTT of  50 ms  and a throughput  of 1 Mbps .  
e) How long does it take to obtain the base HTML? (hint: ignore transmission time)  
f) How long does it take to obtain the entire Web page using non -persistent HTTP without parallel 
connections ? 
g) Repeat b) for using 5 parallel connections , each having an RTT of 50 ms and a throughput of 1 
Mbps .  
h) How long does it take to obtain the entire Web page using persistent HTTP without pipelining?  
i) Repeat d) for persistent HTTP with pipelining.  
j) What is the minimum number of parallel connections that non -persistent HTTP needs  to be 
faster than persistent HTTP without pipelining?  Assume that each connection has the same RTT 
and throughput as in c).  
  

Problem 4  
Consider hosts in an institutional network accessing content via the following network. Suppose each 
object is 80K bits, hosts in the institutional network generate 18 requests/sec, and hosts from other 
parts of the Internet (not shown) generate 100 requests/sec. Suppose that the total delay for Router2 to 
send a request to Router3  and Router3 to send the response back to Router2  is 2 seconds. Ignore 
propagation delays for other links . Ignore the delays from hosts to the cache in the case of cache misses .  
Approximate the access link delay (including queuing and transmission delays) by 1/(ùúáùúá‚àíùúÜùúÜ), where ùúáùúá  is 
the service rate and ùúÜùúÜ is the arrival rate (unit: objects/sec).  
 
a) Find the total delay for obtaining one object from the origin server to a host in the institutional network.  
b) Suppose that 20% of requests generated by the institutional network are served by a local cache  
(i.e., the cache hit rate is 0.2) . Repeat a).  
c) What is the minimum cache hit rate to make the delay no greater than 100 ms  (answer to the 
second decimal place) ?

Problem 5  
Use the tool nslookup to find out :  
a) the IP address and the canonical name of CNN‚Äôs web server (hostname: www.cnn.com ),  
b) the IP address and name of CNN‚Äôs authorative DNS servers  (domain name: cnn.com) , and  
c) the IP address and name of CNN‚Äôs mail servers  (alias: cnn.com) .  
You should submit a printout of the command line input/output and clearly mark the answer to each 
question.  
  

Problem 6  
Consider distributing a file of F=80 Gbits to N peers. The server has an upload capacity of u s=10 Mbps. 
Each peer has a download capacity of d=10 Mbps, and an upload capacity of u. Round all answers to 
integers.  
a) For N=10, 100, 1000, and u=500 Kbps, 2 Mbps, 10 Mbps, make a chart (i.e., a table) giving the minimum file distribution time for each combination of N and u for the client -server 
architecture.  
b) Repeat a) for the P2P architecture.
