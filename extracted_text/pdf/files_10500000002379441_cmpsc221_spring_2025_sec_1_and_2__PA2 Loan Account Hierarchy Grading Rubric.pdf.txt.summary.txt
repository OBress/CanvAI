This PA2 rubric details an OOP loan account hierarchy. It defines a base `LoanAccount` class (principle, rate, months, monthly payment calculation), extended by `CarLoan`, `PrimaryMortgage` (with `Address` object), and `UnsecuredLoan` subclasses. Each has specific properties, constructors, and `toString` methods. Deductions for omissions, bad OOP, or late submission (4% daily, max 40%).
