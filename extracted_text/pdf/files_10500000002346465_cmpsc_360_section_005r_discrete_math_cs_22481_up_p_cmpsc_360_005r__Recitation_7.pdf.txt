1. Determine which functional properties the following functions satisfy and whether they are
bijective:
(a)f:Z→Qandf(x) =2x−3
5
(b)f:R→Randf(x) =3x2+11x
2. Suppose f(x) =√
2x−5,g(x) =5x2−3. What is the domain of f? What is the domain of g?
Find the composite functions below. For each composite function, state the domain.
(a)f◦g(x)
(b)g◦f(x)
(c)f◦f(x)
(d)g◦g(x)
3. Consider the function f:R\{− 4} →R\{2}defined as f(x) =2x−1
x+4.
(a) Determine whether the function fhas an inverse, and if so, find the expression for f−1(x).
(b) Would fhave an inverse if we change the function’s domain and codomain to f:Z\
{−4} →Z\{2}? Explain your reasoning.
4. Let f:Z→Zbe defined by f(x) =x+1 and let g:Z→Zbe defined by g(x) =−x.
Find the composition g◦fand determine if it is a bijection over the set of integers, Z.
5. Given the functions h:M→Nandk:N→Pwhere
M={a,b,c,d,e}
N={j,k,l,m,n}
P={s,t,u,v,w}
and the functions are represented by the rosters:
h={(a,j),(b,k),(c,l),(d,m),(e,n)}
k={(j,t),(k,s),(l,u),(m,v),(n,w)}
Determine k◦handh◦k.
