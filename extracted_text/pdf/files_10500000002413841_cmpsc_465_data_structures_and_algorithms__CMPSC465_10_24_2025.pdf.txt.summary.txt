This content explores Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for managing non-overlapping sets, detailing `union` and `find` operations. It highlights optimizations like weighted-union and path compression, which improve time complexity from O(N) to O(logN) and amortized O(Î±(n)) respectively. DSU is applied to greedy algorithms such as Kruskal's for Minimum Spanning Trees and single-linkage clustering, demonstrated with examples in taxonomy.
