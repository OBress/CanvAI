CMPSC 465 Worksheet 5 focuses on graph algorithms, covering Strongly Connected Components (SCC) analysis including pre/post numbers, component ordering, and metagraphs, plus determining minimum edges for strong connectivity. It also features Dijkstra's algorithm modifications for multi-source shortest paths, paths with edge budget limits, maximum edge weight constraints, and all-pairs shortest paths through a pinned node.
