The Maximum Flow Problem aims to find the highest value flow from a source to a sink in a directed graph, adhering to edge capacities and flow conservation. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm solves this by iteratively finding augmenting paths in a residual graph, which contains forward edges with available capacity and backward edges to reverse existing flow, thereby increasing the total flow until no such path exists.
