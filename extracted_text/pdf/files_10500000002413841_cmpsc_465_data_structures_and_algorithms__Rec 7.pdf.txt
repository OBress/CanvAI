Figure 1: Flow Graph
(a) Find the maximum flow fand a minimum cut using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
(b) Draw the residual graph Gf(along with its edge capacities). In this residual network, mark the
vertices reachable from Sand the vertices from which Tis reachable.
2. Max-Flow Extended Suppose, there are many sources and many sinks, and we wish to maximize the
total flow from all sources to all sinks. This problem can be solved efficiently. Show this by reducing
it to the original max-flow problem.
3. Verifying a max-flow Suppose someone presents you with a solution to a max-flow problem on some
network. Give a linear time algorithm to determine whether the solution does indeed give a maximum
flow.
4. Assigning Projects. A company has nemployees and mprojects. Each employee is qualified to
work on a subset of the projects, and each project requires exactly one employee. However, each
employee can be assigned to at most one project. We need to determine whether it is possible to
assign employees to projects so that every project is staffed, and if so, find such an assignment.
Reduce this problem to max-flow problem and analyze why it is correct.
