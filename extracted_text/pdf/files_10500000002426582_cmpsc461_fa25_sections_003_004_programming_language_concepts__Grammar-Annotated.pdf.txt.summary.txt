CMPSC 461's grammar unit covers syntax analysis, interpreting tokens via Context-Free Grammars (CFGs). Developed by Chomsky and described in BNF/EBNF, CFGs use production rules to define language syntax, enabling string derivations (e.g., leftmost/rightmost). They are more powerful than regular expressions for programming language structures like balanced parentheses, defining the language L(G) for valid strings.
