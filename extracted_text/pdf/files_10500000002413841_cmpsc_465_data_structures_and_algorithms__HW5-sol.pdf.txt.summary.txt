This document covers graph algorithm solutions: running Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) to identify components, sources, sinks, and metagraphs; an O(|V|+|E|) algorithm to find if a graph is one-way connected (all reachable from one vertex); a modified O((|V|+|E|)log|V|) Dijkstra's for unique shortest paths; proof that Dijkstra's works with negative edges only from the source; and an O(|V|+|E|) method to classify BFS edges into tree, back, or cross types, explaining why forward edges are impossible.
