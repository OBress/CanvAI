1. Simplify the following expressions.
(a)¬∀x∃y(P(x,y)∧∃zR(x,y,z))
(b)¬∀x(∃y∀zP(x,y,z)∧∃z∀yP(x,y,z))
Answer:
(a)
¬∀x∃y(P(x,y)∧∃zR(x,y,z))≡ ∃x¬∃y(P(x,y)∧∃zR(x,y,z)) (De Morgan’s Law for Quantifiers)
≡ ∃x∀y¬(P(x,y)∧∃zR(x,y,z)) (De Morgan’s Law for Quantifiers)
≡ ∃x∀y(¬P(x,y)∨¬∃ zR(x,y,z))(De Morgan’s Law for Conjunctions)
≡ ∃x∀y(¬P(x,y)∨∀z¬R(x,y,z)) (De Morgan’s Law for Quantifiers)
(b)
¬∀x(∃y∀zP(x,y,z)∧∃z∀yP(x,y,z))≡ ∃x¬(∃y∀zP(x,y,z)∧∃z∀yP(x,y,z)) (DML for Quantifiers)
≡ ∃x(¬∃y∀zP(x,y,z)∨¬∃ z∀yP(x,y,z))(DML for Conjunctions)
≡ ∃x(∀y∃z¬P(x,y,z)∨∀z∃y¬P(x,y,z)) (DML for Quantifiers)
2. Use the rules of inference to show that the following arguments are valid:
(a)q↔p,q∧r,p→s,s→t⊢t∨r
(b)u→s,p∧(p∨q)→s,u⊢p
Answer:
(a)q↔p=⇒(q→p)∧(p→q)(Def of biconditional)
(q→p)∧(p→q) =⇒(q→p),(p→q)(Simplification)
q∧r=⇒q,r(Simplification)
p→q,q=⇒p(Modus Tollens)
p→s,s→t=⇒p→t(Hypothetical Syllogism)
p,p→t=⇒t(Modus Ponens)
t,r=⇒t∨r(Addition)
(b)u→s,u=⇒s(Modus Ponens)
p∧(p∨q)→s,s=⇒p∧(p∨q)(Modus Tollens)
p∧(p∨q) =⇒p∨(p∧q)(DeMorgan’s Law and double negation)
p∨(p∧q) =⇒p(Absorption Law)

3.Inference rules for predicate logics:
A plant is considered endangered if it has not been found in at least three different locations.
The Blueleaf plant has been found in only one location this year. According to environmental
regulations, an endangered plant cannot be commercially traded. We have a specific Blueleaf
plant in question.
This scenario can be formalized using the following predicates, assuming the universe of dis-
course is the set of all plants:
•E(x):xis endangered.
•F(x,n):xis found in ndifferent locations.
•T(x):xcan be traded.
The term ”Blueleaf” refers to a particular instance of a plant.
Given:
(a)∀x(¬F(x,3)→E(x))- A plant not found in at least three locations is endangered.
(b)∀x(E(x)→ ¬T(x))- An endangered plant cannot be traded.
(c)F(Blueleaf ,1)- The Blueleaf plant has been found in only one location.
To Prove:
•E(Blueleaf )∧¬T(Blueleaf )- The Blueleaf plant is endangered and cannot be traded.
Answer:
Proof :
(a) By Universal Instantiation of assumption (1), we have ¬F(Blueleaf ,3)→E(Blueleaf ).
(b) From assumption (3), F(Blueleaf ,1), we infer ¬F(Blueleaf ,3).
(c) By Modus Ponens of step (1) due to step (2), we conclude E(Blueleaf ), proving the
Blueleaf plant is endangered.
(d) By Universal Instantiation of assumption (2), we get E(Blueleaf )→ ¬T(Blueleaf ).
(e) By Modus Ponens of step (4) due to step (3), we conclude ¬T(Blueleaf ), proving the
Blueleaf plant cannot be traded.
(f) Therefore, we have shown that E(Blueleaf )∧¬T(Blueleaf ), meaning the Blueleaf plant
is both endangered and cannot be traded.

4. Let nbe a positive integer. Prove that if nis an even, then 4 n2+48n+144 is a perfect square.
(a) What is the given statement and your assumptions?
(b) What is your conclusion?
(c) Construct the proof:
Answer:
CMPSC 360, Fall 2024, Worksheet 4 2

(a) For positive n, we assume nis even.
(b) We want to show 4 n2+48n+144 is a perfect square
(c) Proof: By definition of being even, there exists some integer k such that n=2k. Plugging
it back into the equation: 16 k2+96k+144. Factorizing and simplifying: 16 (k2+6k+
9) =16(k+3)2. Since 16 (k+3)2is in perfect square form this proves our statement
QED.
5. Using the direct proof method, prove that if n is an odd perfect square, then n is of the form
4k+1. Answer the questions as directed.
(a) What are the assumptions?
(b) What are you trying to conclude?
(c) Show your work.
Answer: Proof:
(a)Existential instantiation of assumption (a) for term a:n=2a+1
(b)Existential instantiation of assumption (b) for term b:n=b2
(a),(b) =⇒b2=2a+1=⇒b2−1=2a=⇒(b+1)(b−1) =2a
Therefore b+1 orb−1 should be even: ∃x(b+1=2x∨b−1=2x)Case 1: b+1=2x,x∈
Z=⇒n=b2= (2x−1)2=4x2−4x+1=4(x2−x) +1=4k+1 Case 2: b−1=2x,x∈
Z=⇒n=b2= (2x+1)2=4x2+4x+1=4(x2+x) +1=4k+1

6. Consider the following theorem:
”For an integer n, ifnis odd, then n3is odd.”
Verify that the theorem is true using direct proof.
Answer:
Direct Proof: Assume arbitrary n∈Zis odd, then by definition, there exists some k∈Zsuch
thatn=2k+1. Therefore, n3= (2k+1)3=8k3+12k2+6k+1=2(4k3+6k2+3k)+1. Since
k∈Z, 4k3+6k2+3k∈Z, then by definition, n3is also odd. Q.E.D.
