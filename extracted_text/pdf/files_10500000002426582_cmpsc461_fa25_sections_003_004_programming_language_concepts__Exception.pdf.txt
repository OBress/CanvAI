Exceptions
•So far, we assumed each function will run from start to its return points, But 
a program also needs to handle exceptions:
•Out of memory
•Divide by zero
•File not found
•...
CMPSC 461 –Programming Language Concepts

Workaround in C language
•Return a special value (e.g., NULL) when a real value cannot be computed
•Return an explicit ”status” to indicate if an exception happens
•Rely on the caller to pass in the exception handling code (e.g., via function 
pointer)
Exception handling is not enforced in some languages (error-prone)

Exception Handling
•A language feature that
•Isolates error-checking code
•Direct execution to a handler when appropriate
Define exceptions?
How does exception change control flow?
CMPSC 461 –Programming Language Concepts

Define Exceptions
•Pre-defined exceptions
•e.g., divide by zero, out-of-bound array access
•User-defined exceptions
•Typically, defined as a special kind of class

Throwing Exceptions
•Pre-defined exceptions
•Automatically generated
•User-defined exceptions
•Generated by “throw” keyword
