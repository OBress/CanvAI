CMPSC 465 Data Structures & Algorithms
Fall 2025 Ke Chen and Yana Safonova HW 1
Due September 15, 10:00 pm
Instructions: You are encouraged to solve the problem sets on your own, or in groups of three to five
people, but you must write your solutions strictly by yourself. You must explicitly acknowledge in your
write-up all your collaborators, as well as any books, papers, web pages, etc. you got ideas from.
Formatting: Each problem should begin on a new page. Each page should be clearly labeled with the
problem number. The pages of your homework submissions must be in order. You risk receiving no credit
for it if you do not adhere to these guidelines.
Late homework will not be accepted. Please, do not ask for extensions since we will provide solutions
shortly after the due date. Remember that we will drop your lowest three scores.
This homework is due Monday, September 15, at 10:00 pm electronically. You need to submit it via Grade-
scope (Course ID: 1087979). Please ask on Campuswire about any details concerning Gradescope and
formatting.
1.(5 pts.) Getting started . Please read the course policies on the syllabus, especially the course policies on
collaboration. If you have any questions, contact the instructors. Once you have done this, please write “I
understand the course policies.” on your homework to get credit for this problem
2.(36 pts.) Comparing growth rates. In each of the following situations, indicate whether f=O(g), or
f=Ω(g), or both (in which case f=Θ(g)). Justify your answers.
f(n) g(n)
a) 4 n·3n+n504n
b) log (5n) log(4n)
c) en+n102n
d) 7n8n
e) log (n8+n2) log(6n)
f) 2n+n1003·2n+logn
g)√n+logn 4√n+n1/3
h) (log3n)log3n3(log3n)2
i)logn
nn1
n
3.(24 pts.) Proofs.
(a) Prove that 3 n2+4n+5=Θ(n2).
(b) Prove that if f1(n) =O(g1(n))andf2(n) =O(g2(n)), then f1(n) +f2(n) =O(max (g1(n),g2(n))).

(c) Prove that if f(n) =Θ(g(n))andg(n) =Θ(h(n)), then f(n) =Θ(h(n))i.e., transitivity of theta nota-
tion.
4.(14 pts.) Useful Identities. Show the following statements hold true.
(a) Show that
log(n!) =Θ(nlogn).
(b) Show that
n
∑
i=11
i=Θ(logn).
(Hint: To show an upper bound, compare1
iwith1
t, where tis a power of two just smaller than i. To
show a lower bound, compare1
iwith1
t, where tis a power of two just greater than i.)
5.(21 pts.) Recurrence Relations . Solve the following recurrence relations and give the tightest correct
upper bound for each of them in Onotation. Assume that T(O(1)) = O(1). Show all work.
(a)T(n) =4T(n/2) +5n3
(b)T(n) =3T(n/4) +n0.6
(c)T(n) =7T(n/3) +n2
(d)T(n) =8T(n/2) +3n3
(e)T(n) =T(n−1) +dn, where d≥1 is a constant
(f)T(n) =T(n/3) +0.75n
(g)T(n) =T(4n/7) +T(3n/7) +Θ(n). (Hint: Assume T (k)≤cklogk for some constant c >0for all
k<n. Prove that T (n)≤c1nlogn for some constant c 1>0by induction. )
