The PA3 rubric assesses a Customer class's properties (firstName, lastName, SSN, loanAccounts) and methods (constructor, getters, addLoanAccount, printMonthlyReport matching output). The Main method is graded on using provided code, proper formatting ($/%, 2 decimals), and matching example output numbers. Late submissions incur 4% off daily, up to a 40% maximum deduction. Good object-oriented programming practices are also crucial.
