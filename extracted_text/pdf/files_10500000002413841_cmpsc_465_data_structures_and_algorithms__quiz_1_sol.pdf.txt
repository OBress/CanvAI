1.(2 pts.) While performing InsertionSort on the
array{8, 2, 6, 2, 3, 1 }, which of the following is
NOT a transition state of the array:
(a) 2 6 8 2 3 1
(b) 2 2 3 6 8 1
(c) 2 2 8 6 3 1
(d) 2 8 6 2 3 1
(e) None of the above
Answer: (c) For an input array A[1..n], Insertion-
Sort runs from index k=1 tok=nand ensures
that after the k-th iteration the first kelements are
sorted.
2.(2 pts.) When analyzing an algorithm’s running
time, we use big-O to denote its worst-case perfor-
mance and use big-Omega to denote its best-case
performance.
(a) True
(b) False
Answer: False Big-O and big-Omega are used to
describe upper and lower bounds, respectively, on
the growth rate of functions. They are not inher-
ently tied to worst-case or best-case performance.
(Though in practice, algorithm analysis typically fo-
cuses on worst-case or average-case performance, and
best-case performance is rarely considered.)
3.(2 pts.) Let f(n) =10n2andg(n) =n3+5n.
Which of the following is correct?
I.f(n) =O(g(n))
II.g(n) =O(f(n))
(a) I is correct
(b) II is correct
(c) Both I and II are correctAnswer: (a) The (growth rate of the) cubic func-
tiongis not upper bounded by the quadratic func-
tionf.
4.(2 pts.) In order to show 2 (n+1)2=Ω(n2)by
definition, which of the following choices of cand
n0is NOT valid?
(a)c=1.11 and n0=111
(b)c=2.42 and n0=10
(c)c=0.5 and n0=16
(d)c=1 and n0=1
(e)c=2 and n0=3
Answer: (b) By definition of Ω, we need to show
that there exist constants c,n0>0 such that 2 (n+
1)2≥c·n2for all n≥n0. But 2 (n+1)2≥2.42n2
only holds for small n(≤10).
5.(2 pts.) Which of the following statement re-
garding MergeSort is correct?
(a) MergeSort always divides the input array into
two equal halves
(b) MergeSort does not allow duplicate elements
in the input
(c) MergeSort always runs in O(nlogn)time
even if the input array is split arbitrarily at
each step
(d) MergeSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm
where all the sorting happens at the merge
step
(e) None of the above
Answer: (d) (a) the two halves cannot be equal if
the input has an odd length. (b) duplicates are al-
lowed. (c) it becomes a quadratic time algorithm if
we only split out a single element at each step.
