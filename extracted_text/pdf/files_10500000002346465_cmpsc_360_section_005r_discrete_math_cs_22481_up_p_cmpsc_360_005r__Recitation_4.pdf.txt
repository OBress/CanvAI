3.Inference rules for predicate logics:
A plant is considered endangered if it has not been found in at least three different locations.
The Blueleaf plant has been found in only one location this year. According to environmental
regulations, an endangered plant cannot be commercially traded. We have a specific Blueleaf
plant in question.
This scenario can be formalized using the following predicates, assuming the universe of dis-
course is the set of all plants:
•E(x):xis endangered.
•F(x,n):xis found in ndifferent locations.
•T(x):xcan be traded.
The term ”Blueleaf” refers to a particular instance of a plant.
Given:
(a)∀x(¬F(x,3)→E(x))- A plant not found in at least three locations is endangered.
(b)∀x(E(x)→ ¬T(x))- An endangered plant cannot be traded.
(c)F(Blueleaf ,1)- The Blueleaf plant has been found in only one location.
To Prove:
•E(Blueleaf )∧¬T(Blueleaf )- The Blueleaf plant is endangered and cannot be traded.
