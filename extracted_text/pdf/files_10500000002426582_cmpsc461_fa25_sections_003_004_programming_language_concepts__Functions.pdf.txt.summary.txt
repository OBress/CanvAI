Functions (subroutines/methods) can be value-returning or not, using formal parameters and actual arguments. Inline expansion optimizes calls by replacing them with code. Parameter passing mechanisms include Call by Value (copy-in), Call by Result (copy-out), Call by Value-Result (copy-in/out), Call by Reference (address/alias), and Call by Name (textual substitution), influencing how data is shared and modified between caller and callee.
