Simply Typed Lambda Calculus
•Type system: takes program as input and returns either the type of the 
program or rejects the program
•Types: int | bool | string | 1 -> 2
Examples:
•3 A ll the numbers are int and valid program. Well typed.
•λx:int.x Identity function. Well typed.
•λx:int.(x+1) Well typed. int-> int
•(true 3) Not well typed . true can not be a function.
•λx:int.(x x) Not well typed . x is int and int can not be a function.
