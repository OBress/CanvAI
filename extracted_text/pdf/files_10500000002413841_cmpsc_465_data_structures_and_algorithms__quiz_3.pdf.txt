1.(2 pts.) In a min-heap , what is the relationship
between the value of a parent node and its chil-
dren?
(a) The parent node is always greater than its
children.
(b) The parent node is always greater than or
equal to its children.
(c) The parent node is always smaller than or
equal to its children.
(d) There is no specific relationship.
Answer
2.(2 pts.) Performing an IncreaseKey operation on
the root of a max-heap can violate the heap prop-
erty, which requires a HeapifyDown operation to
restore.
(a) True
(b) False
Answer
3.(2 pts.) Consider a max-heap stored in an ar-
rayA[1..7] = [ 7,6,4,1,5,2,3]. After performing
the following two operations in sequence, what is
the resulting heap?
• IncreaseKey(6, 17)
• Insert(12)(a)[7,6,4,1,5,17,3]
(b)[17,7,12,4,1,5,2,3]
(c)[17,12,7,6,5,4,3,1]
(d)[17,12,7,5,6,4,3,1]
Answer
4.(2 pts.) What is the minimum number of nodes
abinary heap can have, given that its height is h?
(a) 2h−1
(b) 2h−1
(c) 2h
(d) 2h−1+1
Answer
5.(2 pts.) A programmer implemented the Heap-
Sort algorithm discussed in lecture, but acciden-
tally used a min-heap instead of a max-heap.
Which of the following is the most likely outcome?
(a) The algorithm will fail to sort the array.
(b) It will sort the array in ascending order, the
same as with a max-heap.
(c) It will sort the array in descending order, the
opposite as with a max-heap.
(d) It will produce a correct sort, but with higher
time complexity.
