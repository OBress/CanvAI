1. Minimum Spanning Trees. Run Prim’s Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree for the following
graph. Whenever there is a choice of nodes, always use alphabetic ordering (e.g. start from node A).
Show the order edges are added and the weight of the partial MST at each step.
2. Minimum Spanning Trees and Subgraphs. LetTbe an MST of graph G. Given a connected
subgraph HofG, show that T∩His contained in some MST of H.
3. Edge Weight Incrementing. Consider an undirected graph G= (V,E)with nonnegative edge weights
we≥0. Suppose that you have computed a minimum spanning tree of G, and that you have also com-
puted shortest paths to all nodes from a particular node s∈V.
Now suppose each edge weight is increased by 1: the new weights are w′
e=we+1.
(a) Does the minimum spanning tree change? Give an example where it changes or prove it cannot
change.
(b) Do the shortest paths change? Give an example where they change or prove they cannot change.
4. Minimum Spanning Trees
(a) Given an undirected graph G= (V,E)and a set E′⊂E, briefly describe how to update Kruskal’s
algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree that includes all edges from E′.
(b) Assume you are given a graph G= (V,E)with positive and negative edge weights and an al-
gorithm that can return a minimum spanning tree when given a graph with only positive edges.
Describe a way to transform Ginto a new graph G′containing only positive edge weights so
that the minimum spanning tree of Gcan be easily found from the minimum spanning tree of
G′.
