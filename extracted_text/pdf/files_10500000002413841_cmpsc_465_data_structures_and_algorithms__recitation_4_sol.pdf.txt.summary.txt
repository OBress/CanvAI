This worksheet covers graph algorithms, detailing DFS for traversal, pre/post-visits, and edge classification. Solutions include linear-time algorithms for awardee lineup via topological sort, bipartite graph detection using two-coloring DFS, water pouring puzzle pathfinding, constant-time ancestor queries using pre/post-visit times, and calculating max descendant values in trees.
