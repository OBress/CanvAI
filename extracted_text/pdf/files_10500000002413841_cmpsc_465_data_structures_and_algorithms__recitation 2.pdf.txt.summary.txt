CMPSC 465 Worksheet 2 (Fall 2025) focuses on algorithms for data structures. Topics include finding the k-th smallest element in sorted arrays, maximum element in matrices using divide-and-conquer, selection algorithms (recurrences, median finding), k-way merge strategies, and finding array rotations in logarithmic time.
