The Transport Layer manages end-to-end communication, offering multiplexing/demultiplexing. UDP provides connectionless, best-effort service. TCP ensures reliable, ordered data transfer using sequence numbers, ACKs, timers, and pipelining (e.g., Go-Back-N/Selective Repeat). It incorporates flow control via receive windows and robust congestion control through AIMD (slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit), established by a 3-way handshake.
