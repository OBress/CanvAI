Chapter 6 details the Link Layer's role in datagram transfer between adjacent nodes, covering services like error detection/correction (CRC, parity) and medium access control (e.g., CSMA/CD, TDMA). It explores LANs, including MAC addressing, ARP, Ethernet frames, self-learning switches, and VLANs for network segmentation. Also introduced are MPLS for link virtualization, data center networking, and the journey of a web request through these layers.
