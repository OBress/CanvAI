Case study

University Park (summer 2023). The University Park campus employs a hub and spoke architecture. 
Eight campus-spanning distribution routers are connected to the hub center via 100 Gbps Ethernet. 
The majority of the PSU community implements LAN connectivity to the UEN backbone at OSI layer 2 or layer 3 via one of these eight distribution routers. 
The Penn State UEN offers customer transport via unicast IPv4 and IPv6 natively, multicast IPv4, WAN Ethernet via Q-in-Q, and VPLS. 
Customer facing UEN connections are generally either 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps Ethernet. 
The eight distribution routers at University Park each maintain 100 Gbps connectivity to a redundant hub center. 
Approximately 40% of Penn State buildings have redundant network connections to two different distribution routers, with plans to achieve 100% in 2025.

1-21

Introduction

Packet-switching: store-and-forward

takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out) L-bit packet into link at R bps
store and forward: entire packet must  arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link

numerical example:
L = 7.5 Mbits
R = 1.5 Mbps
e2e delay = 10 sec

Introduction

Packet-switching: directly forward*

takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out) L-bit packet into link at R bps
directly forward: each bit is forwarded onto next link as it arrives

numerical example:
L = 7.5 Mbits

Introduction

Alternative core: circuit switching

end-end resources allocated to, reserved for “call” between source & dest:
in diagram, each link has four circuits. 
call gets 2nd circuit in top link and 1st circuit in right link.

Packet switching versus circuit switching

example:
1 Mb/s link
each user: 
0.1 Mb/s when “active”
active 10% of time

circuit-switching: 
10 users (1 Mbps / 0.1 Mbps)
packet switching: 
with 35 users, probability > 10 active at same time is less than .0004 


packet switching allows more users to use network!

packet switching is great for bursty traffic
resource sharing
simpler, no call setup
circuit switching is great for constant bit-rate traffic
Audio/video
excessive congestion is possible under packet switching
protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control (chapter 3)
how to provide bandwidth guarantees needed for audio/video apps is still an unsolved problem (chapter 7)

Is packet switching a “slam dunk winner?”

Internet structure: network of networks

ISP (Internet Service Provider): organization operating part of the Internet
Hosts connect to Internet core via access ISPs 
residential, company, and university ISPs
Access ISPs in turn are interconnected by tier-1 ISPs and regional ISPs
so that any two hosts can send packets to each other
Result: a complex “network of networks”

Introduction

3 key performance metrics

Delay: time for a packet (or a sequence of packets) to travel from one point to another point
per-hop delay, end-to-end delay
Loss (rate): fraction of packets lost in transmission 
Throughput: rate (bits/sec) at which data are transmitted from sender to receiver


1-34

Introduction

4 sources of one-hop delay

dproc: nodal processing 
reconstruct packet, check bit errors (if so  loss)
determine output port
typically < msec

 dqueue: queueing delay
time waiting at output port for transmission 
depends on congestion level of router

1-35

Introduction

dtrans: transmission delay:
L: packet length (bits) 
R: link bandwidth (bps)
dtrans = L/R

dprop: propagation delay:
d: length of physical link (meters)
s: propagation speed (2~3x108 m/sec)
dprop = d/s

Caravan analogy: single packet

cars “propagate” at 100 km/hr
toll booth takes 12 sec to service car (bit transmission time)
car ~ bit; caravan ~ packet
Q1: How long until caravan is lined up before 2nd toll booth?


time to “push” entire caravan through toll booth = 12*10 = 120 sec
time for last car to propagate to 2nd toll both: 100km/(100km/hr)=1 hr
A1: 62 minutes
Q2: Where is the first car when the caravan passes the first toll booth?

1-37

Introduction

Caravan analogy: single packet

suppose cars now “propagate” at 1000 km/hr


A: Yes!  after 7 min, first car arrives at second booth; three cars still at first booth

and suppose toll booth now takes 1 min per car
Q: Will cars arrive to 2nd booth before all cars serviced at first booth?

L bits

R bps

d meters

Q1: will the first bit arrive before the last bit departs?


Q2: what is the minimum R such that the first bit does not arrive before the last bit departs?



A1: yes, because d/s < L/R

A2: 22.4 Mbps to satisfy d/s ≥ L/R

* Check out the interactive animation

Introduction

1-40

End-to-end delay 

Usually, the source and destination hosts are connected by a multi-hop path:

message: an application-layer “packet” (e.g., an HTTP message)
message segmentation: split the message into smaller packets, each propagating freely
no message segmentation: the message propagates as a single packet

Introduction

Caravan analogy: multiple packets

car ~ packet, caravan ~ sequence of packets (a message)
Propagation: 1000 km/hr, toll booth: 1 min/car

Q1: How long to reach 3rd toll booth if caravan must travel together (no message segmentation)?

Q2: How long if cars travel separately (with message segmentation)?

Q3: What if the second toll booth takes 2 min/car?

1-41

booth

A1: 32 min

A2: 23 min

A3: 42 min (no segmentation), 33 min (segmentation)

End-to-end delay exercise

One message of length M=1 Mbits, segmented into 1000 packets of length L=1 Kbits, 3-hop path, link capacity R=5 Mbps, length d=100 km, propagation speed s = 2.8 x 108 m/sec.

Q1: what is the delay saving by message segmentation?


Q2: what is the delay saving when each packet has a 40-byte header?



A1: 601 ms – 201.5 ms = 399.5 ms

A2: 601.3 ms – 265.6 ms = 335.7 ms

Introduction

1-43

Pros and cons of message segmentation

+ reduce e2e delay (thanks to pipelining)
+ waste less bandwidth in retransmission in case of bit errors
+ require less buffer space at routers

message needs to be reassembled at destination
total amount of data transfer increased due to packet headers

Introduction

Packet loss

Two causes of loss:
queue overflow: queue (aka buffer) preceding link has finite capacity, packet arriving to full queue is dropped 
bit error: packet with detected bit error is dropped (more later in chapter 6...) 
Lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node, by source host, or not at all

malware can get in host from:
virus: self-replicating infection by receiving/executing  object (e.g., e-mail attachment)
worm: self-replicating infection by passively receiving object that gets itself executed
spyware malware can record keystrokes, web sites visited, upload info to collection site
infected host can be enrolled in  botnet, used for spam, DDoS attacks

Introduction

Denial of Service (DoS): attackers make resources (server, bandwidth) unavailable to legitimate traffic by overwhelming resource with bogus traffic

Introduction

Physical media

communication link: logical connection betweentransmitter/receiver pairs that can transmit bits
physical media: what lies between transmitter & receiver
guided media: 
signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax
unguided media: 
signals propagate freely, e.g., radio

twisted pair (TP)
two insulated copper wires
Widely used in telephone network (100 Kbps)
Category 5 Ethernet: 100 Mbps – 1 Gbps
Category 6 Ethernet: 10Gbps

Introduction

Physical media: coax, fiber

coaxial cable:
two concentric copper conductors
Bidirectional
Speed: 10-100 Mbps
broadband:
multiple channels on cable
HFC (hybrid fiber coaxial)

fiber optic cable:
glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
high-speed operation:
high-speed point-to-point transmission (e.g., 10’s-100’s Gbps transmission rate)
low error rate: 
repeaters spaced far apart 
immune to electromagnetic noise

no physical “wire”
bidirectional
propagation environment effects:
reflection 
obstruction by objects
interference

radio link types:
terrestrial microwave
1-100 GHz
up to 45 Mbps
LAN (e.g., WiFi)
2.4-5.9 GHz
11, 54, 450 Mbps
wide-area (e.g., cellular)
4G cellular: 0.6-5.7 GHz, ~ 10 Mbps
satellite
Kbps to 45Mbps channel (or multiple smaller channels)
270 msec end-end delay
geosynchronous versus low altitude

Introduction

Internet structure: Summary

at center: small # of well-connected large networks
“tier-1” commercial ISPs (e.g., Level 3, Sprint, AT&T, NTT), national & international coverage
content provider network (e.g., Google): private network that connects it data centers to clients, often bypassing tier-1, regional ISPs

“Real” Internet delays and routes

what do “real” Internet delay & loss look like? 
traceroute program: provides delay measurement from source to router along end-end Internet path towards destination.  For all i:
sends three packets that will reach router i on path towards destination
router i will return packets to sender
sender times interval between transmission and reply.
