Chap 1: Introduction

Concepts
Internet, protocol
Edge: access networks (DSL, Cable, Ethernet, wireless)
Core: 2 networking paradigms (packet/circuit switching), 2 key network core functions (routing, forwarding), structure of Internet core


Protocols
Protocol stack
Analysis
#supported users using circuit switching vs. packet switching
Delay calculation (N-hop path, w/ or w/o segmentation)
Throughput (bottleneck link capacity)
Loss (causes of loss)


2

Chap 2: Application Layer

Concepts
Application architectures (CS, P2P)
Client/server process, sockets (TCP/UDP)
Transport services (lossless? secure? delay? throughput?)
Protocols
HTTP: transport layer, persistent vs. non-persistent, cookie
Email: transport layer, SMTP, POP/IMAP, HTTP

DNS: transport layer, 3+1 types of DNS servers, two ways to query DNS (iterative, recursive)
Analysis
Webpage downloading time: type of HTTP
Single object downloading time: Internet/access/LAN delay, caching
File distribution time (CS, P2P)


3

Chap 3: Transport Layer

Concepts
TCP vs. UDP
Identifier of UDP/TCP socket
Protocols
UDP: segment format
TCP: segment format (meaning of seq#, ack#), differences from go-back-N/selective-repeat, flow control,  congestion control (3 phases, cwnd updates)




Analysis
Checksum
rdt design: stop-and-wait 
rdt: pipelined (go-back-N, selective repeat, TCP), min #distinct sequence numbers
TCP timeout value: EstimatedRTT, DevRTT
TCP throughput: per-window rate, long-term rate

Chap 4: Network Data Plane

Concepts
Two key network-layer functions
Router: 4 + 3 + 3
4 components
3 line card functions
3 types of switching fabrics
Addressing: IP address, subnet, CIDR, DHCP


Protocols
IPv4 (IP fragmentation) vs. IPv6 (3 removed features, 1 added feature)
Analysis
Forwarding table entries: IP addresses ↔ prefix
IP fragmentation (ID, flag, offset)
Subnet prefix
Configure OpenFlow switches

5

Chap 5: Network Control Plane

Concepts
two architectures of control plane
Centralized vs. decentralized routing algorithms
SDN (3 components, 3 controller functions)
Protocols
Intra-AS routing vs. Inter-AS routing
BGP (eBGP/iBGP): BGP route attributes, BGP route selection

ICMP (underlying protocol, ping, traceroute)
SNMP (underlying protocol, two modes)
Analysis
Dijkstra: algorithm
Distance vector: algorithm, count-to-infinity, poisoned reverse

6

Chap 6: Link Layer

Concepts
link layer communication entity
Error detection: parity check, checksum, CRC
Protocols
Multiple access protocols: three families, example protocols per family

LAN: MAC address, ARP, switch
VLAN: port-based VLAN, trunk
Analysis
Calculation of error detection codes
Efficiency of random access protocols

7

Chap “7”: Physical Layer

Concepts
parameters of a periodic signal (amplitude, frequency, phase)
cutoff frequency
signal vs. data
digital vs. analog 
2 classes of modulation schemes (baseband, passband) 

Protocols
baseband modulation: 4 line codes & use cases
passband modulation: 4 schemes 
Analysis
Fourier analysis: bit rate vs. #harmonics
Digitization: data rate based on signal bandwidth & #quantization levels

Summary 

The network is evolving…
New applications require new protocols
TCP evolves
IP evolves
SDN goes wide area
“name/content”-based networking
5G -> 5G++
