The Java Collections Framework offers generic data structures like Lists (ordered, allowing duplicates), Sets (unordered, unique elements), Maps (key-value pairs), and Queues (priority-based). It facilitates handling primitive types via type-wrapper classes and autoboxing, provides `Collections` utility methods for operations like sorting/searching, and offers synchronized/unmodifiable wrappers. Java SE 9 introduced convenience factory methods for creating small, immutable collections.
