Java inheritance creates subclasses from superclasses ("is-a" relationship) for code reuse, extending members and overriding methods. It's single-inheritance from Object. Constructors chain to superclass. While `protected` allows subclass access, `private` superclass variables with public accessors are preferred for robust, less coupled designs. Composition offers a flexible, loosely coupled alternative to inheritance.
