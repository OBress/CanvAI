Java exception handling uses `try-catch-finally` to manage runtime problems (e.g., `ArithmeticException`), allowing programs to continue. Exceptions inherit from `Throwable`; checked types require `catch`/`throws`, unchecked are `RuntimeException` subclasses. `finally` blocks and `try-with-resources` ensure resource deallocation. Custom/chained exceptions and assertions support robust error management.
