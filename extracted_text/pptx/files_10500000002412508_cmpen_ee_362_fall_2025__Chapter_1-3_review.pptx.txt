Underlying mechanism & performance analysis


1

Chap 1: Introduction

Concepts
Internet, protocol
Edge: access networks (DSL, Cable, Ethernet, wireless)
Core: 2 networking paradigms (packet/circuit switching), 2 key network core functions (routing, forwarding), structure of Internet core


Protocols
Protocol stack
Analysis
#supported users using circuit switching vs. packet switching
slide Chap1-28
Delay calculation (N-hop path, w/ or w/o segmentation)
slide Chap1-42
Throughput (bottleneck link capacity)
Loss (causes of loss)


2

pkt switching

.

Chap 2: Application Layer

Concepts
Application architectures (CS, P2P)
Client/server process, sockets (TCP/UDP)
Transport services (lossless? secure? delay? throughput?)
Protocols
HTTP: transport layer, persistent vs. non-persistent, conditional GET 

DNS: transport layer, 4 types of DNS services, 3+1 types of DNS servers, 4 types of RR, two ways to query DNS (iterative, recursive)
Analysis
Webpage downloading time: type of HTTP
slide Chap2-17, 20, 21
Single object downloading time: Internet/access/LAN delay, caching
slide Chap2-35 to 2-41
File distribution time (CS, P2P)


3

Chap 3: Transport Layer

Concepts
TCP vs. UDP
Identifier of UDP/TCP socket
Protocols
UDP: segment format, why using UDP
TCP: segment format (meaning of seq#, ack#), differences from go-back-N/selective-repeat, flow control,  congestion control (3 phases, cwnd updates)




Analysis
Checksum
rdt design: stop-and-wait 
slide Chap3-34 to 3-42
rdt: pipelined (go-back-N, selective repeat, TCP), min #distinct sequence numbers
TCP timeout value: EstimatedRTT, DevRTT
TCP throughput: per-window rate, long-term rate
slide Chap3-87

Exam format

Scope: Chap1-3
Total 30 pt (30% of final grade)
3 types of problems
Short answer/true or false  concepts [10 pt]
Calculation  analysis [10 pt]
Design  application of concept [10 pt]
In-class (50 min)
closed-book (including book, slides, notes, cheat sheets, Internet, etc), calculators allowed, discussion not allowed


Example:
Type 1: what is Internet from xxx view, what are the layers in Internet protocol stack
Type 2: how many users can be supported using packet/circuit switching by a link of x bps, if a user needs y bps and is active z% of time 
Type 3: design a stop-and-wait rdt to transfer segments from sender(s) to receiver(s) in order xxx
