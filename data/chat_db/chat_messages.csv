12,11,assistant,"Based on the information for `lec1.pdf`, the first lecture of CMPSC 465 covered graph algorithms. Specifically, it included:

*   Strongly Connected Components (SCC) analysis
*   Shortest path variations, such as multi-source BFS and adaptations of Dijkstra's algorithm",2025-10-26T16:12:03Z

20,12,assistant,"Of course! Hereâ€™s a quick summary of those course materials.

It looks like you have a list of files from two different computer science courses:

*   For **Cmpsc221 (Spring 2025)**, the list includes several programming assignments, such as a ""Functional Programming Assignment,"" a ""Pizza Servings Calculator,"" and a ""Course Scheduler."" There is also a video showing an example of how the final project is graded. One file is a chapter from a Java textbook covering files and input/output streams.

*   For **Cmpsc461 (Fall 2025)**, the materials are optional readings, including a link to an article on ""Short-Pause Garbage Collection.""

Overall, it's a mix of programming projects for your Java course and some supplemental readings for your Programming Language Concepts course.",2025-10-26T16:46:06Z
