8,2,assistant,"Based on the most recent files and assignments for CMPSC 465, it looks like you've been focusing on graph algorithms.

Specifically, recent topics include:
*   Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
*   Breadth-First Search (BFS) for finding shortest paths
*   Dijkstra's algorithm and its limitations (like with negative-weight edges)

This material was covered in Quiz 5 and is also the focus of Homework 5.",2025-10-26T05:38:12Z
